# In computer animation, a "jiffy" is commonly defined as 1/100th of a second. Define a function named
# jiffies_to_seconds that takes the number of "jiffies" as a parameter, and returns the number of seconds.
# Then, write a main program that reads the number of jiffies (float) as an input, calls function jiffies_to_seconds()
# with the input as argument, and outputs the number of seconds.
#
# Output each floating-point value with three digits after the decimal point, which can be achieved as follows:
# print(f'{your_value:.3f}')


def jiffies_to_seconds(user_jiffies):
    jiffies = user_jiffies / 100
    return jiffies


if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_jiffies = float(input())
    print(f'{jiffies_to_seconds(user_jiffies):.3f}')
