Note: You are only submitting your pseudocode in this part of the assignment!

Your program should implement a simple guessing game with the following requirements:

Generate a random number between 1 and 50 and then have the user guess the number. The program should tell the user
 whether they have guessed too high or too low and allow them to continue to guess until they guess the number or
 enter a 0 to quit.

When they guess the number it should tell them how many guesses it took.  At the end, the program should ask them if
 they want to play again and allow them to continue.

For example:

Enter a guess 1-50, or 0 to quit: 25
Too high!
Enter a guess 1-50, or 0 to quit: 15
Too low!
Enter a guess 1-50, or 0 to quit: 100
Guess must be between 1 and 50!
Enter a guess 1-50, or 0 to quit: 18
That's it! You took 3 guesses to get the number.

Would you like to play again? (Y/N) N
Come back soon!

Notes:

The program should include some basic input validation.
For this first part you will only be submitting your plan/pseudocode for the program. (Do not submit full code,
only english-like descriptions of how your program will run with, possibly, some simple lines of code like variable declarations.)

You should go back and look at Chapter 2 where we discussed pseudocode. But, it's similar to how the Hints/Walk-thrus
are written, but generally with less code than those have and more description. Here's some more info: What is
